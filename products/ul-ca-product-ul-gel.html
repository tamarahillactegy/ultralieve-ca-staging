				<h2>Ultralieve 250ml Gel</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Our Ultralieve Treatment Gel has been specifically developed to conduct Ultralieve’s ultrasound waves deep into the tissue.</p>
					<p>Like with any ultrasound therapy it is essential to use an ultrasound gel on the treatment area when using Ultralieve in order to reduce friction and assist in the transmission of the ultrasonic waves. If the gel amount is inadequate, the effectiveness of the therapy may be reduced by up to 90%.</p>
					<p>Ultralieve. Your body for life</p>

				<h2>About Ultralieve</h2>
				<p>Ultralieve is designed to relieve pain by supporting the healing process to aid tissue repair. Whether it’s gardening, cycling, looking after the kids, going for a long walk or a physically demanding job, the ability to move with freedom is vital to your everyday life.</p>
				<p>Ultralieve uses very high frequency sound vibrations (so high they cannot be felt) to stimulate tissue up to 5cm beneath the skin’s surface. Non-thermal ultrasound, as used by Ultralieve, speeds up the healing process by allowing the body to better transport proteins that are the essential building blocks to generate new tissue. For the example of a ligament tear, the application of ultrasound can help speed up production of collagen.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, Ultralieve supports your body’s natural healing process so you can get back to your best.</p>

				<h2>What other people are saying...</h2>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">“I have had this rotator cuff injury since I was young, and I’ve done stretching, physio, and a bunch of other things that didn’t seem to work. The Ultralieve has a really been working for me. I am really impressed”</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:35px;font-weight:bold;font-size:18px;">James Hutchinson, Montreal, QC</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">"I used Ultralieve 3 times a day for about 5 weeks simply applying the gel and moving the device around the affected area, it started to feel lots better and with regular applications I was able to play the rest of the season pain free!"</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:35px;font-weight:bold;font-size:18px;">James Paxton</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">“When I was a young lad I thought that I was invincible, and that my body would never ‘give up on me’.</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">I had always been a keen skier so I was pretty devastated when I was no longer able to keep up. I spoke to a fellow keen skier about my plight and he mentioned that he had found a personal ultrasound treatment called Ultralieve. This sounded good to me so I gave it a try. The improvement was amazing, I still had pain in the afternoons – but after a day of pounding the slopes, what could I expect! I skied every day of my holiday!”</p>
